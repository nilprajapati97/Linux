## 1. Introduction
Process states represent the dynamic lifecycle of computational execution. Understanding these states and their transitions is crucial for grasping how operating systems manage computational resources efficiently.

## 2. Fundamental Process States

### a. New State
- Process is being created
- Resources are being allocated
- Not yet ready for execution
- Initialization of process control block (PCB)

### b. Ready State
- Process is prepared for execution
- Waiting in the process queue
- All required resources are available
- Awaiting CPU scheduler selection

### c. Running State
- Process is currently executing
- Actively using CPU resources
- Instructions are being processed
- Can transition to other states based on events

### d. Waiting (Blocked) State
- Process is temporarily suspended
- Waiting for external event
- Common triggers:
  - I/O operations
  - Inter-process communication
  - Resource allocation
  - External synchronization signals

### e. Terminated State
- Process execution is complete
- Resources are being deallocated
- Process control block is being removed
- Memory is being freed

## 3. State Transition Mechanisms

### Transition Types
1. **Scheduler-Driven Transitions**
   - Moving between Ready and Running states
   - Controlled by CPU scheduling algorithms

2. **Event-Driven Transitions**
   - Moving to Waiting state due to external events
   - Triggered by I/O, resource constraints

3. **Interrupt-Based Transitions**
   - Sudden state changes due to hardware or software interrupts
   - Ensures system responsiveness and multitasking

## 4. State Transition Algorithms

### Round-Robin Scheduling
- Circular queue of processes
- Fixed time quantum for each process
- Ensures fair CPU time distribution

### Priority-Based Transitions
- Processes assigned priority levels
- Higher priority processes get preferential state transitions
- Prevents starvation of low-priority processes

## 5. Practical Implementation Considerations

### Context Switching
- Saving and restoring process states
- Minimal overhead during transitions
- Preserving process execution context

### Race Conditions
- Synchronization challenges during state transitions
- Need for atomic state change operations
- Mutex and semaphore mechanisms

## 6. Code Example: Process State Simulation

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

// Process state enumeration
typedef enum {
    NEW,
    READY,
    RUNNING,
    WAITING,
    TERMINATED
} ProcessState;

// Process Control Block (Simplified)
typedef struct {
    int pid;
    ProcessState state;
    int priority;
} PCB;

// Function to simulate state transition
void transition_state(PCB *process, ProcessState new_state) {
    printf("Transitioning Process %d: %d -> %d\n", 
           process->pid, process->state, new_state);
    process->state = new_state;
}

int main() {
    PCB process;
    process.pid = getpid();
    process.state = NEW;
    process.priority = 5;

    // Simulating state transitions
    transition_state(&process, READY);
    sleep(1);  // Simulate preparation time
    
    transition_state(&process, RUNNING);
    sleep(2);  // Simulate execution
    
    transition_state(&process, WAITING);
    sleep(1);  // Simulate waiting for resource
    
    transition_state(&process, READY);
    sleep(1);
    
    transition_state(&process, TERMINATED);

    return 0;
}
```

## 7. Compilation and Execution Instructions

### For Linux/Unix Systems:
```bash
# Compile the program
gcc -o process_states process_states.c

# Run the executable
./process_states
```

### Compilation Flags Explanation
- `-o process_states`: Specify output executable name
