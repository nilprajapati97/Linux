/*
1. Graceful Shutdowns (e.g., SIGINT Handling)
Scenario: A server or daemon needs to clean up resources before exiting.
    Application:
            Instead of exiting immediately on Ctrl+C, the program intercepts the signal to:
            Close open files
            Release memory
            Notify other services
            Log shutdown reason
        
            Example:
                   signal(SIGINT, handle_shutdown);


2. Temporary Protection from User Interruptions
Your Code Use Case:
    // Ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT initially
    // Then allow them after a certain condition (e.g., after alarm or count)

    Real Use:
            During critical operations (e.g., database update, flash firmware write), you might want to disable user interrupts.
            After the critical section, signals are re-enabled to allow safe exit.

3. Rate-Limiting or Debouncing User Input
Your Counter Code:
                    if (c == 3) signal(SIGINT, SIG_DFL);
Real Use:
        Require the user to press Ctrl+C multiple times before quitting:
        Prevents accidental exits
        Used in CLI tools (e.g., Git, Vim sometimes handles interrupts carefully)

4. Soft Exit with Escalation
        Your SIGINT 3 times logic:
Real Use:
        First Ctrl+C: Show warning.
        Second: Ask for confirmation.
        Third: Exit forcefully.
    Used in tools like:
        top
        htop
        Command-line tools with long-running processes

5. Automatic Timeouts (Using alarm() + SIGALRM)
Your Code Use Case:
        alarm(10); // Timeout after 10 seconds
    Real Use:
        Auto-terminate if no input received within X seconds
    Used in:
        Login screens (auto logout on idle)
        Network services waiting for response
        Security/lock screens

6. Security: Disable Abort (Ctrl+\)
        Programs that run in public terminals or embedded devices may disable Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT) to avoid exposing core dumps or debugging behavior.

7. Child Process Management in Daemons
        Signals like SIGCHLD, SIGTERM, and SIGINT are managed similarly to:
        Monitor when child processes finish
        Handle termination signals in a parent process or supervisor daemon
