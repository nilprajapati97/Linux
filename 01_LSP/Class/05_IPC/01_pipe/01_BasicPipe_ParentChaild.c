Scenario:
Classic unidirectional communication between parent and child using pipe() and fork().

This code demonstrates a simple parent-child process communication using pipes in C.

Output:
Child received: Hello from parent


This code creates a pipe, forks a child process, and allows the parent to write a message
to the pipe, which the child reads and prints.
This is a basic example of inter-process communication using pipes in C.
This code is designed to be compiled with the C17 standard.
It demonstrates the use of `pipe()`, `fork()`, and basic read/write operations.
It is a foundational example for understanding IPC in C.
This code is suitable for educational purposes and can be extended for more complex IPC scenarios.
