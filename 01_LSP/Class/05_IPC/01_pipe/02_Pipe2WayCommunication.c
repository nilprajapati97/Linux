/*
ðŸ”„ 2. Two-Way Pipe: Bidirectional Communication
==========================================================
This code demonstrates a two-way communication between a parent and child process using pipes in C.
It creates two pipes: one for parent-to-child communication and another for child-to-parent communication.
The parent process writes a message to the child, and the child responds back to the parent.
This is a common pattern in inter-process communication (IPC) where both processes can send and receive
Scenario:

Pipes are unidirectional, so use two pipes for two-way communication.
