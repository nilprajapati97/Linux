# üßµ Multithreading in Linux ‚Äî Interview Q\&A (10 Years Exp)

---

## 1. **What is a thread in Linux, and how does it differ from a process?**

### Answer:

* **Process**: Independent execution unit with its **own address space**.
* **Thread**: Lightweight execution unit within a process that **shares address space** (code, heap, global data) with other threads, but has its own **stack and registers**.
* **Linux Implementation**:

  * Uses **CLONE flags** (`clone()` syscall) to create threads.
  * `pthread_create()` (POSIX API) internally uses `clone()`.
* **Key Difference**:

  * Process ‚Üí separate memory, heavier context switch.
  * Thread ‚Üí shared memory, lighter context switch, good for parallelism.

üëâ Interview Tip: Explain **`clone()` vs `fork()`**.

* `fork()` ‚Üí child has separate memory.
* `clone()` ‚Üí child can share resources depending on flags (`CLONE_VM`, `CLONE_FILES`, etc.).

---

## 2. **How do you create threads in Linux?**

### Answer:

Using **POSIX Threads (pthreads)** library.

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void* thread_func(void* arg) {
    printf("Thread running: %d\n", *(int*)arg);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t tid;
    int val = 10;

    if (pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread_func, &val) != 0) {
        perror("pthread_create failed");
        exit(1);
    }

    pthread_join(tid, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

* `pthread_create()` ‚Üí creates a new thread.
* `pthread_join()` ‚Üí waits for thread to finish.

---

## 3. **Explain synchronization primitives in Linux threads.**

### Answer:

Since threads share memory ‚Üí need **synchronization** to avoid race conditions.

* **Mutex (`pthread_mutex_t`)**

  * Ensures only one thread accesses critical section.
* **Condition Variables (`pthread_cond_t`)**

  * Used with mutexes to signal/wait.
* **Spinlocks (`pthread_spinlock_t`)**

  * Busy-wait lock, used in real-time scenarios.
* **Read-Write Locks (`pthread_rwlock_t`)**

  * Multiple readers allowed, writer exclusive.
* **Barriers (`pthread_barrier_t`)**

  * Synchronize multiple threads at a point.
* **Semaphores (`sem_t`)**

  * Counting synchronization, producer-consumer problems.

---

## 4. **What happens if you use a mutex in an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)?**

### Answer:

* **Mutex cannot be used in ISR** because:

  * Mutex may **sleep** (block until available).
  * ISRs run in **atomic context** ‚Üí cannot sleep.
* **Alternative**:

  * Use **spinlocks** in kernel ISR (don‚Äôt sleep).
  * For userspace, handle synchronization outside ISR (via eventfd, signals).

---

## 5. **What are race conditions, and how do you debug them?**

### Answer:

* **Race condition**: Multiple threads access shared resource without proper synchronization ‚Üí leads to unpredictable results.

### Debugging Tools:

* **Helgrind (Valgrind tool)** ‚Üí detects race conditions.
* **ThreadSanitizer (TSan)** ‚Üí GCC/Clang runtime checker.
* **GDB** with `thread apply all bt` ‚Üí see stack traces of all threads.
* **strace/ltrace** ‚Üí to check syscalls from threads.

---

## 6. **Explain deadlocks and how to prevent them.**

### Answer:

* **Deadlock**: Two or more threads wait forever due to circular resource dependency.

### Example:

```c
pthread_mutex_lock(&A);
pthread_mutex_lock(&B); // thread 1

pthread_mutex_lock(&B);
pthread_mutex_lock(&A); // thread 2
```

Both block forever.

### Prevention:

1. **Lock ordering** ‚Üí always acquire locks in same order.
2. **Timeouts** (`pthread_mutex_timedlock()`).
3. **Trylocks** (`pthread_mutex_trylock()`).
4. **Avoid unnecessary locks** (use lock-free structures).

---

## 7. **What is the difference between user-level threads and kernel-level threads?**

### Answer:

* **User-Level Threads (green threads)**:

  * Managed by userspace runtime.
  * Faster context switch, but no parallelism on multi-core.
* **Kernel-Level Threads**:

  * Managed by kernel (Linux pthreads = kernel threads).
  * True parallel execution on multiple cores.
  * Higher context switch overhead.

üëâ Linux uses **1:1 threading model** ‚Üí each pthread = one kernel thread.

---

## 8. **How does Linux schedule threads?**

### Answer:

* Threads are treated as **tasks** by the Linux scheduler.
* Identified by **TID (Thread ID)** (unique, unlike PID).
* Scheduling policies:

  * **SCHED\_OTHER** (default, CFS scheduler).
  * **SCHED\_FIFO / SCHED\_RR** (real-time).
* `sched_setscheduler()` API allows setting scheduling policy.

---

## 9. **How do you achieve inter-thread communication in Linux?**

### Answer:

* **Shared memory + synchronization (mutex/condvar)**.
* **Pipes / sockets** ‚Üí even within same process.
* **Message queues** (`mq_* APIs`).
* **Futex** (Fast Userspace Mutex) ‚Üí low-level kernel mechanism for pthreads.

---

## 10. **What is a futex and why is it important?**

### Answer:

* **futex (Fast Userspace Mutex)** is a Linux syscall used internally by `pthread`.
* Allows threads to synchronize **without kernel involvement** unless contention occurs.
* Workflow:

  * If lock is free ‚Üí acquire in userspace (fast).
  * If contended ‚Üí kernel futex syscall puts thread to sleep.
* Important for performance ‚Üí reduces syscall overhead.

---

## 11. **Explain Thread Local Storage (TLS).**

### Answer:

* Each thread needs its own private copy of a variable.
* Use **`__thread` keyword** in C.

```c
__thread int counter = 0; // Each thread has its own counter
```

* POSIX API: `pthread_key_create()`, `pthread_setspecific()`, `pthread_getspecific()`.

---

## 12. **How to set CPU affinity for a thread?**

### Answer:

Pin a thread to a CPU for performance.

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <sched.h>

cpu_set_t cpuset;
CPU_ZERO(&cpuset);
CPU_SET(2, &cpuset);   // Bind to CPU 2

pthread_setaffinity_np(pthread_self(), sizeof(cpu_set_t), &cpuset);
```

Used in **real-time systems, performance tuning**.

---

## 13. **Explain memory consistency issues (cache coherence).**

### Answer:

* On multi-core CPUs, each core has its own cache.
* Without synchronization, one thread may see **stale data**.
* C provides `volatile` but it‚Äôs not enough ‚Üí need **memory barriers** (`__sync_synchronize()`, atomic operations).
* POSIX provides `pthread_mutex` which ensures proper memory ordering.

---

## 14. **Real-time multithreading concerns in Linux?**

### Answer:

* Use **SCHED\_FIFO** or **SCHED\_RR** policies.
* Lock memory (`mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE)`) to avoid paging.
* Avoid blocking syscalls (disk I/O, malloc).
* Use **RT Preempt kernel** for deterministic scheduling.

---

## 15. **Common Interview Scenario Question**

üëâ *‚ÄúYou have multiple producer and consumer threads. How will you design it?‚Äù*

### Answer:

* Use **bounded buffer**.
* Synchronize with:

  * **Mutex** ‚Üí protect buffer.
  * **Condition variables** ‚Üí signal producer/consumer.

---
