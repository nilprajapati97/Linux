Nice — I’ll break **Smack** down *block-by-block* (clean, modular), explain exactly what each block does, how they connect, the kernel/userland interfaces you’ll use, and practical commands/examples you can run on an embedded device or QEMU image. I’ll flag the most important facts with short citations so you can follow the authoritative docs.

# 1) Big picture — what Smack *is* (one-sentence)

Smack (Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel) is a **lightweight, label-based LSM** that enforces mandatory access control by comparing short text *labels* on subjects (processes) and objects (files, sockets, other processes) against a tiny rule-table; it’s designed for simplicity and embedded use. ([MJM Wired][1])

# 3) Block details — one block at a time

## Block 1 — LSM integration (kernel entry points)

* Smack is an LSM module embedded in the kernel; it installs hooks on file/socket/process ops and is consulted at access time. That means Smack decisions are enforced inside the kernel—unbypassable by ordinary userland. Build-time kernel config `CONFIG_SECURITY_SMACK` is required and the system typically mounts a small control FS to talk to Smack at runtime. ([Kernel.org][2], [MJM Wired][1])

---

## Block 2 — Labels & special-label semantics (the primitives)

* **Labels** are short ASCII strings attached to subjects and objects. Labels are opaque to Smack (it compares equality) but there are reserved single-character labels with special rules (e.g., `_`, `^`, `*`, `?`, `@`) that change default behavior so the system “just works” unless you explicitly lockdown. Example defaults: reads/executions to `_` may be permitted; `^` often grants read/exec to processes bearing it; `*` can be treated permissively for objects. These special rules let Smack be minimally intrusive by default. ([docs.legato.io][3])

---

## Block 3 — Label storage (where labels live)

* **Files/objects:** labels are stored in extended attributes (`xattr`) such as `security.SMACK64` and related attributes (exec, transmute, ipin/ipout, mmap). Filesystems with xattr support (ext4, f2fs, etc.) are recommended so labels persist in the image. You set/get them using `setfattr/getfattr` or `attr/chsmack` helpers. ([Android Git Repositories][4], [docs.legato.io][5])
* **Processes:** the running process label is visible under procfs, e.g. `/proc/<pid>/attr/current` (or `/proc/self/attr/current`). A process that execs a binary with an exec-label will get the exec label (see next block). ([Android Git Repositories][4])

---

## Block 4 — Exec label / process label transition (SMACK64EXEC)

* You can set an **exec label** on a file (`security.SMACK64EXEC`). When the kernel `exec()`s that file, the new task is started with that exec-label as its subject label (subject to privilege checks). This is how you ensure a given binary always runs with an intended Smack label. ([Android Git Repositories][4], [docs.legato.io][5])

---

## Block 5 — Rule engine & control interface (`smackfs`)

* Smack exposes a tiny control pseudo-FS (commonly mounted at `/sys/fs/smackfs` or `/smack`). To add rules you write lines of the form:

  ```
  subject_label object_label rights
  ```

  to the `load` (or `load2`) interface; the runtime rule table updates immediately. Persistent configs are typically stored in `/etc/smack/accesses` and written into `load2` at boot. ([Linux Kernel Documentation][6], [MJM Wired][1])

---

## Block 6 — Rights string & semantics (`r w x a t l -`)

* The access string consists of characters from `r w x a t l` (plus `-` used as placeholder). Meaning:

  * `r` = read
  * `w` = write
  * `x` = execute
  * `a` = append
  * `t` = **transmute** (special flag for creation/inheritance; see block 7)
  * `l` = lock (file locking semantics)
* Example rule: `AppA AppA-data rwx--` (allow r/w/x). The allowed characters and the `load2` format are documented in kernel docs. ([Linux Kernel Documentation][6], [docs.redpesk.bzh][7])

---

## Block 7 — Transmute & file-creation inheritance

* **Problem solved:** if two apps with different labels need to share a directory, the creator’s label would normally be applied to the new file, which might make the other app unable to read it.
* **Transmute feature:** mark the directory with a transmute attribute (`security.SMACK64TRANSMUTE`) and grant the subject `t` in the rule: when a process writes into that directory under a rule that includes `t`, the new object inherits the *directory’s* label (not the creator’s). This creates a shared-dropbox behavior without weakening global rules. It’s very handy for embedded share-directories. ([Android Git Repositories][4], [Information Security Stack Exchange][8])

---

## Block 8 — Privilege & onlycap (who can change rules/labels)

* Smack integrates with Linux capabilities: `CAP_MAC_ADMIN` and `CAP_MAC_OVERRIDE` control whether a process can set labels or override checks. By default these capabilities may be effective for root processes, but Smack provides a mechanism (`/sys/fs/smackfs/onlycap` or `onlycap`) to **restrict which labels** are allowed to exercise these capabilities — this prevents “all root” from being a universal key and scopes MAC administration to small privileged labels. Use this to reduce the power of root under Smack. ([Kernel.org][9], [git.sceen.net][10])

---

## Block 9 — Networking (socket labels & CIPSO)

* Smack can tag sockets with labels (`security.SMACK64IPIN`, `security.SMACK64IPOUT`) and rely on the netlabel/CIPSO stack so labels can be carried across IPv4 with CIPSO options. Be careful: many networks and middleboxes strip/ignore IP options — so cross-host Smack packet-labeling can be fragile; it’s often used only in closed or lab environments. ([Linux Kernel Documentation][11], [Android Git Repositories][4])

---

## Block 10 — Startup / persistence

* Typical embedded flow:

  1. Build image with file labels applied where possible (Yocto/Buildroot recipe support or a first-boot relabel step).
  2. Provide a persistent `/etc/smack/accesses` (or `/etc/smack/accesses.d/*`) containing the rules you want at boot.
  3. During init, mount `smackfs` and `cat /etc/smack/accesses > /sys/fs/smackfs/load2` (or use `smackload`) so the rule table is loaded before services start. This ensures services run under their intended labels and can access the files they need. ([Linux Kernel Documentation][6], [MJM Wired][1])

---

## Block 11 — Tools & debug interfaces

* Common tools / interfaces:

  * `getfattr -n security.SMACK64 /path` or `getfattr -d /path` — read file label.
  * `setfattr -n security.SMACK64 -v "Label" /path` — set file label.
  * `setfattr -n security.SMACK64EXEC -v "Label" /usr/bin/app` — set exec label.
  * `/sys/fs/smackfs/load2` or `/sys/fs/smackfs/load` — write rules.
  * `/proc/self/attr/current` — shows process label.
  * `chsmack`, `smackload`, `smackctl` — helper utilities on some distros. ([Android Git Repositories][4], [GitHub][12])

**Where denials show:** kernel logs (dmesg / `journalctl -k`) — Smack prints denial messages that identify subject label, object path, attempted operation; tail the kernel log while you exercise services.

---

## Block 12 — Concrete example sequence (copy-paste)

(assumes `smackfs` mounted at `/sys/fs/smackfs`)

```bash
# 1) Mount smackfs (if not auto)
sudo mkdir -p /sys/fs/smackfs
sudo mount -t smackfs smackfs /sys/fs/smackfs

# 2) Label a file (object)
sudo setfattr -n security.SMACK64 -v "AppA-data" /tmp/secret.txt

# 3) Set exec label on binary
sudo setfattr -n security.SMACK64EXEC -v "AppA" /usr/local/bin/writer

# 4) Add rule allowing AppA to write AppA-data (rights: w)
echo "AppA AppA-data w----" | sudo tee /sys/fs/smackfs/load2
# (or use 'rwxat-' style string as needed; kernel accepts 'rwxat-')

# 5) Run writer; it now runs with label AppA and can write /tmp/secret.txt
/usr/local/bin/writer
```

For transmute (shared drop directory):

```bash
# mark directory with transmute label
sudo setfattr -n security.SMACK64 -v "DropLabel" /srv/drop
sudo setfattr -n security.SMACK64TRANSMUTE -v "1" /srv/drop

# allow Subject to write with transmute 't'
echo "Subject DropLabel rwxt-" | sudo tee /sys/fs/smackfs/load2
```

(These commands are the usual low-level admin steps; production systems tend to perform them during image build or via init scripts.) ([Linux Kernel Documentation][6], [Information Security Stack Exchange][8])

---

## Block 13 — Security properties, limits & best practices

* **Security strengths**

  * Very small policy surface and small code complexity → easier to reason about and audit.
  * Label equality model is simple to teach and maintain for embedded teams.
  * Transmute + exec-labels give direct, practical patterns for shared directories and sandboxed apps. ([archive.fosdem.org][13], [docs.legato.io][5])

* **Limitations / gotchas**

  * Path-independent but xattr-dependent: if your filesystem lacks xattrs, labels can’t persist. Use ext4/f2fs or set labels at runtime. ([Android Git Repositories][4])
  * Netlabel/CIPSO-based networking can be fragile across public networks (IP options issues). ([Linux Kernel Documentation][11])
  * It’s simpler than SELinux, but that also means fewer expressive constructs like roles or MLS policies. Choose Smack when simplicity + low maintenance is the priority. ([MJM Wired][1])

* **Best practices**

  * Apply labels at image-build time when possible (Yocto recipe snippets or a first-boot relabel step).
  * Use `onlycap` to restrict who can change labels / rules (minimize CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN usage). ([Kernel.org][9], [git.sceen.net][10])
  * Use transmute for shared-drop directories instead of making broad rules. ([Information Security Stack Exchange][8])
  * Start in permissive/testing mode while you iterate rules and then enable enforcement in CI/OTA flows.

---

# 4) Quick cheat-sheet (files & commands)

* Kernel mount: `/sys/fs/smackfs` (or `/smack`) — `load2`, `onlycap`, etc. ([Linux Kernel Documentation][6])
* File label xattr: `security.SMACK64` (get/set with `getfattr/setfattr`). ([Android Git Repositories][4])
* Exec label xattr: `security.SMACK64EXEC`. ([Android Git Repositories][4])
* Transmute attr: `security.SMACK64TRANSMUTE`. ([Android Git Repositories][4])
* Rule loader: `echo "Subject Object rwxat-" > /sys/fs/smackfs/load2`. ([Linux Kernel Documentation][6])
* Process label view: `cat /proc/self/attr/current`. ([Android Git Repositories][4])

---

# 5) Where to read next (authoritative quick links)

* Kernel Smack docs (admin-guide LSM Smack) — definitive runtime/control details. ([Linux Kernel Documentation][6])
* Android / kernel Smack docs (attributes & exec semantics). ([Android Git Repositories][4])
* Smack whitepaper / embedded slides for design rationale and examples. ([archive.fosdem.org][13])

If you want, I can now **produce a runnable demo** (tiny writer program + exact commands you can run inside QEMU or your board) or a **Yocto recipe snippet** that applies Smack labels at image build time and runs `smackload` during init. Which would help you most next?
