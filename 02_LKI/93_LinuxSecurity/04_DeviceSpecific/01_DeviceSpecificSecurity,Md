## 🔑 4. Device-Specific Security

In embedded Linux, **security must consider hardware integration**:

* **Secure Boot (U-Boot + Kernel)**

  * Only signed bootloaders, kernels, and rootfs images are allowed.
* **TPM / HSM integration**

  * Trusted Platform Module or Hardware Security Module for key storage.
* **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**

  * e.g., ARM TrustZone → critical code runs in “secure world”.
* **Device Tree Restrictions**

  * Disable unused peripherals to avoid attack surface
