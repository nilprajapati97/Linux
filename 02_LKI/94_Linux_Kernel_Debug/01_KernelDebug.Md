ðŸš€ Top Debugging & Tracing Tools Every Android/Linux Engineer Must Master

Working in AOSP, Android Automotive OS (AAOS), or Linux kernel development means dealing with complex interactions between framework, HAL, and kernel layers. Debugging efficiently requires the right set of tools. Here are some of the most powerful ones ðŸ‘‡
ðŸ”¹ ftrace
Built into the Linux kernel.
Captures function calls, latencies, and scheduling details.
Ideal for root cause analysis of performance bottlenecks.
ðŸ”¹ eBPF / BCC (BPF Compiler Collection)
Modern kernel technology for safe, programmable tracing.
Used for system observability, profiling, and monitoring live production systems.
Flexible compared to static tracing methods.
ðŸ”¹ kprobes
Dynamic instrumentation of running kernel code.
Hook into almost any kernel function without rebooting.
Perfect for debugging low-level kernel behavior.
ðŸ”¹ debugfs
Virtual filesystem exposing kernel internals.
Provides insights into memory, processes, and subsystems.
Great for quick runtime inspection.
ðŸ”¹ gdb / gdbserver
Classic debugging tools for native C/C++ development.
Essential for stepping through code, inspecting variables, and debugging native crashes.
gdbserver allows remote debugging on embedded/Android targets.
ðŸ”¹ DDMS (Dalvik Debug Monitor Server)
Legacy Android debugging tool (replaced by Android Studio Profiler).
Still useful for thread analysis, heap monitoring, and log inspection in older versions.
ðŸ”¹ Tombstones / debuggerd
Native crash dump mechanism in Android.
Provides stack traces, register states, and memory info after a crash.
Vital for diagnosing production crashes.
ðŸ”¹ Systrace
Timeline-based visualization of system performance.
Helps identify UI jank, I/O delays, and CPU scheduling issues.
Widely used in performance tuning for apps and system services.
ðŸ”¹ dumpstate
Collects comprehensive system logs, dumps, and status.
Generates bugreports useful for cross-team debugging.
Often the first step in field debugging.
ðŸ”¹ logger
Simple yet powerful logging interface.
Helps developers capture structured logs (logcat) from apps and system components.
Essential for day-to-day debugging.
