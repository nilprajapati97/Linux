Good question ðŸ‘Œ â€” when the **board vendor provides nothing** (no BSP, no kernel patches, no defconfig), you basically have to **reverse-engineer your way up**. The kernel selection process is critical, because it determines whether you can even boot to a shell. Letâ€™s go step by step.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Identify the CPU/SoC

Even if your board vendor gave nothing, **you must at least know the SoC (System-on-Chip)** used on the board.

Ways to figure it out:

* Look at the **silkscreen marking** on the SoC chip.
* Check with `lscpu` or `cat /proc/cpuinfo` if you can boot over UART with some boot ROM monitor.
* Use JTAG to detect CPU architecture.
* Look for **reference design documents** from the SoC vendor.

ðŸ‘‰ The kernel is **not tied to the board itself** but to the **SoC family**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Check Mainline Linux Support

Once you know the SoC:

* Go to [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org) or LTS trees.
* Search for your SoC name inside the kernel sources:

```bash
grep -r <SoC_name> arch/arm/ arch/arm64/ drivers/
```

If your SoC family is already supported (e.g., ARM Cortex-A53 with existing support in `arch/arm64/mach-*`), **start from there**.

If not supported:

* Pick the **closest SoC in the same family** (same CPU core + similar peripherals).
* Example: If you have an ARM Cortex-A9 SoC not listed, you can start with another Cortex-A9 supported SoC and adapt.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Choose the Kernel Version

* If your SoC family has **good support in mainline**, pick the latest **LTS kernel** (e.g., `6.6.x LTS`).
* If your SoC is **not in mainline**, youâ€™ll need to:

  * Either port it to mainline yourself (long effort),
  * Or start from an **older kernel** that has similar hardware supported and then **forward-port drivers step by step**.

ðŸ‘‰ Strategy:

* **For new designs** â†’ go with **latest LTS kernel** for long-term stability.
* **For legacy SoCs** (unsupported in mainline) â†’ start with the **last known vendor kernel** of a similar chip, even if outdated, then forward-port.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Minimal Kernel Config

Without BSP, you must **craft your own defconfig**:

1. Start with an existing `defconfig` of a similar SoC:

```bash
make ARCH=arm multi_v7_defconfig     # for 32-bit ARM
make ARCH=arm64 defconfig            # for ARM64
```

2. Enable only essentials:

   * `CONFIG_SERIAL_*` (your UART console)
   * `CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK` or `CONFIG_DEBUG_UART` for bring-up
   * `CONFIG_MMC`, `CONFIG_ETHERNET`, or `CONFIG_I2C` as needed later
   * `CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE` (optional) for minimal rootfs

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Device Tree (DTS) Selection

Linux kernel **needs a DTS file** to know board hardware.

* Check `arch/arm/boot/dts/` or `arch/arm64/boot/dts/` for existing SoC-level DTS.
* If not present, create a new one by copying a similar SoC board DTS and adjusting:

  * Memory size + base address
  * UART base address for console
  * Clock tree + timers

ðŸ‘‰ At minimum, your DTS must have **CPU, memory, timer, UART** nodes for Linux to boot and print messages.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Rootfs Strategy

Since no BSP/rootfs is given:

* Start with **initramfs** (busybox-based minimal FS) â†’ embed it directly into kernel (`CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE`).
* Once UART works â†’ switch to external storage (SD card, eMMC, NAND, or NFS root).

---

## âœ… Summary (Kernel Selection without Vendor BSP)

1. **Identify SoC** â†’ check mainline support.
2. **Pick kernel** â†’ latest LTS if supported, otherwise closest SoCâ€™s last working kernel.
3. **Base defconfig** â†’ use multi\_v7\_defconfig (ARM32) or defconfig (ARM64).
4. **Device Tree** â†’ create from similar SoC, at least with CPU+DDR+UART.
5. **Minimal bring-up** â†’ enable UART console + initramfs.
6. **Iteratively add peripherals** (MMC, Ethernet, I2C, etc.) once you have boot logs.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to write you a **step-by-step kernel bring-up template** (with minimal DTS + defconfig + initramfs busybox setup) so you can boot Linux to a shell on UART for the first time?
