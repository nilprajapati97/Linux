*The ARM Interrupt Hierarchy: How Nested Handling Ensures Critical Tasks Never Wait*


Interrupts are the backbone of responsive, real-time systems. But what happens when a critical event occurs while your processor is already busy handling another one? This is where nested interrupt handling comes in.

This flowchart breaks down the entire process from a beginner's perspective to a deeper, more technical understanding.

For Beginners:
It's like a phone call. When you're on a call (Interrupt A) and a more urgent call from your boss comes in (Interrupt B), you put the first call on hold. You handle the urgent one, hang up, and then seamlessly return to your original call. This is exactly what your processor does: it saves the state of the first task to handle the more urgent one and then resumes where it left off.

For Intermediate & Expert Engineers:
 * Priority is Key: Not all interrupts are created equal. In ARM, the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) manages different priority levels. A higher priority interrupt can preempt a lower priority one.

 * The Power of the Stack: The processor automatically saves the current state (like the Program Counter and Status Register) to the stack before jumping to the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). For nested interrupts, the state of the first ISR is also saved, ensuring a seamless return.

 * Optimized Switching: Advanced features like tail-chaining and late arrival minimize the overhead of switching between interrupts, ensuring maximum efficiency and responsiveness in your system.
Understanding this fundamental concept is crucial for building robust and reliable applications, especially in areas like automotive, IoT, and medical devices where timing is critical.
