Here’s a clear, end-to-end view of the **Project Execution Life Cycle** you can use across software/embedded/BSP projects. It’s organized by phases, with deliverables, gates, and practical checklists. (Think: PMBOK/PRINCE2 fundamentals, plus Agile/DevOps practices where they help.)

# 1) Initiation (Why + What)

**Objective:** Prove the project is worth doing and define guardrails.
**Key activities**

* Problem statement, goals, success criteria (business + technical).
* High-level scope, constraints, assumptions.
* Option analysis (build/buy/reuse), early risk scan, rough cost/schedule.
* Stakeholder mapping & governance model (CCB, steering cadence).
* Draft compliance needs (e.g., ISO 26262/ASIL, security/regulatory).
  **Core artifacts**
* Business case, Project Charter, high-level roadmap, initial risk register.
  **Gate / exit criteria**
* Charter approved, funding endorsed, sponsor + PM appointed, governance agreed.

# 2) Planning (How + When + How Much)

**Objective:** Convert vision into executable, controlled work. Baseline scope/schedule/cost.
**Key activities**

* **Scope & WBS:** Break into deliverables → work packages → tasks. Define acceptance criteria.
* **Schedule:** Network diagram, critical path, buffers; resource loading; dependencies.
* **Cost & Resources:** Bottom-up estimates, S-curve, contingency & management reserve.
* **Risk:** Identify → analyze (probability × impact) → plan responses; risk burn-down plan.
* **Quality:** Standards, DoR/DoD, code review/static analysis rules, test strategy & coverage targets.
* **Configuration & Change:** Versioning, branching, baselines; CCB workflow & SLAs.
* **Procurement/Vendor:** RFP/SoW, deliverables, milestones, acceptance, warranties/penalties.
* **Security & Compliance:** Threat model, SBOM, hardening, audit plan; safety cases (if applicable).
* **Communication & Stakeholders:** Cadence, channels, RACI, escalation paths.
  **Core artifacts**
* Scope baseline (WBS + dictionary), Schedule baseline (Gantt/CPM), Cost baseline.
* Management plans: risk, quality, change, config, test/verification, communications, procurement.
  **Gate / exit criteria**
* Baselines approved, teams staffed, environments planned, suppliers onboarded.

# 3) Execution (Build + Integrate)

**Objective:** Deliver scope to plan while coordinating people, vendors, and environments.
**Typical cadence**

* Kickoff → iterations/sprints (2–4 weeks) or work-package milestones in waterfall/hybrid.
* Daily standups/Kanban flow for visibility and blockers.
  **Engineering best-practices (software/embedded)**
* Requirements elaboration → architecture → design reviews (SRR/PDR/CDR).
* Coding guidelines, peer reviews, **static analysis**, MISRA (if relevant).
* Unit tests (≥ X% coverage), integration tests, HIL/SIL where needed.
* CI/CD: build → test → package → deploy to staging labs; artifact retention & provenance.
* Environment matrix: toolchains, compilers, SDKs, target HW variants; reproducible builds.
* Defect lifecycle: triage SLAs, severity/priority policy, escape analysis.
  **Management controls**
* Track progress vs baselines; manage risks, issues, changes; vendor performance reviews.
  **Core artifacts**
* Incremental builds/releases, test reports, review minutes, updated risk/issue logs.
  **Gate / exit criteria**
* Feature complete (or planned increments complete), defect thresholds met, traceability satisfied.

# 4) Monitoring & Controlling (Stay on Track)

**Objective:** Keep the project aligned with baselines; course-correct early.
**Techniques**

* **EVM**: PV (planned value), EV (earned value), AC (actual cost).

  * CPI = EV/AC; SPI = EV/PV.
  * Forecasts: EAC ≈ BAC/CPI (simple), or AC + (BAC–EV)/(CPI×SPI) (schedule-aware).
* Schedule control: critical path drift, near-critical paths, buffer consumption.
* Quality control: defect trends, DRE, test pass rates, MTTR, coverage.
* Risk control: risk burn-down, trigger monitoring, contingency usage.
* Change control: CCB decisions, impact analysis, baseline updates.
* Stakeholder reports: status (RAG), KPIs, decision logs.
  **Gate / exit criteria**
* KPIs within thresholds; approved changes integrated; no unresolved critical risks for go-live.

# 5) Closure (Finish Well)

**Objective:** Obtain formal acceptance, capture learning, and hand over sustainably.
**Key activities**

* Acceptance & sign-off; verify scope completion and success criteria.
* Handover: operations runbooks, SLAs/SLOs, monitoring & alerting, warranty/maintenance plan.
* Financial close: invoices, accruals, variance explanations.
* Retrospective & Lessons Learned; archive artifacts; release resources; celebrate wins.
  **Core artifacts**
* Acceptance certificate, final report, lessons-learned, support transition package.

## Practical “Do-This” Checklists

### A) Phase Exit Checklist (quick)

* **Initiation → Planning:** Charter approved, sponsor named, budget placeholder, governance set.
* **Planning → Execution:** Scope/schedule/cost baselines signed; risk plan; environments ready; access granted; vendors contracted.
* **Execution → Release:** All tests passed to agreed coverage; defects under threshold; security/compliance checks green; rollback plan ready; stakeholders trained.
* **Closure:** Acceptance signed; docs archived; support transitioned; finances closed; retro done.

### B) Core Controls to Implement Day-1

* Single source of truth: backlog + WBS mapped to requirements (ID-level traceability).
* CI pipeline with unit tests + static analysis as hard gates.
* Definition of Ready/Done (DoR/DoD) visible; code review mandatory.
* Risk register live, reviewed weekly; RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) board.
* CCB with 48–72h SLA for change decisions.

### C) Embedded/BSP specifics

* Hardware availability plan (EVT/DVT/PVT units), lab time scheduling.
* Boot chain & recovery strategy (SPL/U-Boot/fastboot), secure boot enablement plan.
* Kernel/device-driver branch strategy; defconfig and patch series policy.
* Board bring-up logs & traceability: boot logs, dmesg captures, schematics cross-refs.
* Safety (ASIL): HARA, safety goals, safety case artifacts; independence in verification.
* Compliance & licensing: SPDX tagging, SBOM, third-party review.

## Governance & Roles (RACI snapshot)

* **Sponsor/SteerCo:** Approves funding & major scope changes (A).
* **Project Manager:** Baselines, schedule, risk, reporting (R).
* **Tech Lead/Architect:** Technical decisions, design reviews, quality gates (R).
* **QA/Verification Lead:** Test strategy, evidence, sign-off (R).
* **Configuration Manager/DevOps:** CI/CD, environments, releases (R).
* **Procurement/Vendor Manager:** Contracts, delivery oversight (R).
* **Stakeholders (Ops/Support/Sec/Compliance):** Inputs & approvals at gates (C/A).

---

## Metrics That Matter

* **Delivery:** CPI, SPI, milestone hit rate, rework %, lead/cycle time, throughput.
* **Quality:** Defect density, escape rate, DRE, code coverage, static analysis violations.
* **Reliability/SRE:** Availability, MTTR, change fail rate, deployment frequency.
* **Risk:** Open risk exposure (\$ or score), % risks with active responses.
* **Team health:** Focus factor, attrition, WIP per person, PR review time.

---

## Hybrid Agile Without Chaos (what works)

* Use **stage-gates** for funding/compliance, **sprints** for delivery.
* Baseline *epics* to scope/cost; let *stories* flex within change limits.
* Keep a thin but real **requirements–tests–code** traceability thread.
* Maintain **two plans** in sync: release roadmap (SteerCo) and sprint plan (team).

---

## Common Failure Modes (and fixes)

* **Gold-plating / scope creep:** Strict change control; tie changes to business value.
* **Invisible risks:** Force weekly risk reviews with owners and triggers.
* **Environment drift:** Immutable builds, containerized toolchains, pinned compilers/SDKs.
* **Late integration surprises:** Shift-left testing, CI on every commit, nightly full integrations.
* **Vendor slippage:** Contractual milestones with acceptance tests; earned value on deliverables.

---

## Minimal Set of Artifacts (by phase)

* **Initiation:** Charter, stakeholder map, business case.
* **Planning:** WBS, baselines (scope/schedule/cost), management plans (risk, quality, change, comms, config, test), procurement plan.
* **Execution:** Build/release notes, test reports, review records, updated RAID.
* **Monitoring/Control:** Status reports, EVM dashboard, CCB log, forecast (EAC).
* **Closure:** Acceptance, final report, lessons learned, handover pack.

* **Month 2–4:** Core bring-up + driver enabling; CI + static analysis gates; early integrations.
* **Month 5–6:** Feature complete; system testing on DVT; performance/security hardening.
* **Month 7–8:** Pilot/field trials; defect burn-down; documentation & support training.
* **Month 9:** Release & closure; warranty/support transition.
