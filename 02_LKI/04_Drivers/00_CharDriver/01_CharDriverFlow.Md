Just wanted to share a snapshot of the character device driver initialization/registration flow in Linux kernel for anyone starting their journey into kernel programming, as writing a character device driver is like writing the "Hello, World!" program when starting the journey of the Linux kernel learning.

This image showcases the key steps:
𝐀𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫: Using alloc_chrdev_region() to get a major and minor number.
𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐝𝐞𝐯: Setting up our character device with cdev_init() and linking our file operations.
𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐝𝐞𝐯 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦: Making the device live with cdev_add().
𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Using class_create() and device_create() to automatically create the device file in /dev (like /dev/my_device).

Hope this is helpful for aspiring kernel developers!
