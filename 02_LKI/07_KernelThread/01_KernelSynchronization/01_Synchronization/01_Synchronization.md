Here's how to pick the right synchronization primitive to use in your Linux kernel code.

Note: The list and image below do not include details about all possible synchronization primitives in the Linux kernel; for example, details about wait queues and RCUs are intentionally omitted to fit the information into a LinkedIn post.

Use Spinlock when: Critical section is very short, in interrupt context, or when deterministic timing is crucial

Use Mutex when: You need ownership semantics - same task must lock/unlock, or need deadlock debugging

Use Semaphore when: Managing a pool of N resources (count > 1), or need counting synchronization (For binary semaphore usage, consider alternatives like mutex or completion variables first)

Use Completion when: Waiting for one-time events, interrupt handlers need to signal process context, or async operation completion

Use Atomics when: Simple counters/flags, reference counting, or building lock-free algorithms
