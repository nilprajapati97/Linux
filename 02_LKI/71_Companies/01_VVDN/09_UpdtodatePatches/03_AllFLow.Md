Yes 👍 — that’s the smart move. In an interview you don’t want to narrate 50 commands, just a **short structured workflow (8–10 steps)** that shows your **practical knowledge + process awareness**.

Here’s the **Interview-Ready Summary**:

# **Kernel Update Workflow (Interview Version)**

1. **Monitor sources** – Track kernel.org (LTS/stable), LKML/stable mailing list, vendor BSP repos, and CVE advisories.

2. **Fetch new release** – Pull latest LTS tag (e.g., `v6.6.45`) from kernel.org.

3. **Create update branch** – Start a new branch from your current BSP kernel (`bsp-6.6.44`).

4. **Rebase BSP patches** – Rebase your vendor/product patches on top of the new stable kernel. Resolve conflicts if any.

5. **Build kernel & DTB** – Cross-compile with existing config (`olddefconfig`).

6. **Smoke test on hardware** – Boot board, check kernel boots, `/proc/version`, console, rootfs.

7. **Run regression tests** – Validate subsystems (I2C, SPI, USB, Networking, Power). Run automated test suite if available.

8. **Check security coverage** – Verify CVE patches included in changelog, run static/dynamic analysis tools.

9. **Finalize & tag release** – Tag as `bsp-6.6.45`, push to repo, document changes.

10. **Deploy to product** – Package kernel + modules, deliver via OTA/firmware update.

👉 This shows **end-to-end understanding** (tracking → integrating → testing → deployment) without drowning in commands.
If the interviewer digs deeper, you can expand with the **practical commands** from the longer version.

Would you like me to make this into a **one-page “cheat sheet” PDF** (with both diagram + short summary) so you can keep it handy for interview prep?
