# BSP Validation: end-to-end playbook

## 1) Start with purpose, scope, and traceability

* **Purpose**: prove the BSP (bootloader + kernel + DT + rootfs + drivers) is **functional, stable, performant, power-safe, and secure** for the target product/use-cases.
* **Scope**: list in-scope subsystems (UART/I²C/SPI/GPIO/USB/Eth/Wi-Fi/BT/PCIe/Display/Camera/Audio/Storage/Power/Thermal/OTA/Security). Note out-of-scope/deferred items.
* **Traceability**: create a mapping **Requirement ID → Test ID** (your CSV matrix does this). Define **P0/P1/P2 priorities** and **entry/exit criteria** (e.g., 100% P0 pass, ≥95% P1 pass, no Critical defects).

## 2) Define test strategy (layers & depth)

* **Smoke (P0 gate)**: boot to shell, console works, storage mounts, network up.
* **Functional** (per-subsystem feature coverage).
* **Integration/System**: end-to-end flows (e.g., camera capture → display → encode).
* **Performance**: boot time, network/storage throughput, IRQ/scheduling latency.
* **Power/Thermal**: suspend/resume, runtime PM, cpufreq/cpuidle, thermal throttling.
* **Reliability/Soak/Stress**: 24–72h burn-in, reboot loops, mixed workloads.
* **Security**: secure boot chain, SELinux/AppArmor, CVE conformance, hardening.
* **Recovery**: watchdog, pstore/kdump, A/B rollback & OTA resilience.

## 3) Lab & environment setup

* **Hardware**: target board(s) with revision tracking, PSU, serial (USB-UART), USB hubs, network switch, cameras/displays/sensors, logic analyzer if needed.
* **Infra**: DHCP/TFTP/NFS servers, OTA server, artifact storage, remote PDU for power cycling, host tools (fastboot/dfu-util/adb/iperf3/ethtool).
* **Images**: exact U-Boot, kernel, DTB(s), rootfs, versioned and immutable.
* **Safety & repeatability**: fixed PSU voltage/current limits; temperature and ambient noted; time synced (RTC/NTP).

## 4) Design tests by subsystem (what to verify & how)

For each item, capture **Pre-conditions → Steps → Expected → Pass/Fail → Negative/Stress**. Examples:

### Bootloader (SPL/U-Boot)

* Console at **115200 8N1**, environment save/load, storage read (eMMC/SD/NOR), fastboot/DFU, boot from all supported media, secure-boot verification (if applicable).

### Kernel + Device Tree

* Boots without **Oops/BUG/WARN**; essential drivers probe; `dmesg` clean.
* DT correctness: compatible strings, clocks/regulators/resets/IRQs.
* Module load/unload (if modular).

### Low-level I/O (UART/GPIO/PWM/ADC)

* UART loopback, RTS/CTS; GPIO direction/IRQ; PWM frequency/duty accuracy; ADC accuracy window vs datasheet.

### Buses (I²C/SPI/CAN/PCIe)

* I²C device enumeration + ID reads; SPI mode/bits/CS timing at min/max speeds; CAN bitrates & error handling; PCIe enumeration, BAR access, MSI/INTx.

### Storage (eMMC/SD/NAND/SATA/USB-MSC)

* Partition discovery, FS mount (ext4/f2fs/squashfs), throughput and IOPS, power-cut resilience.

### USB (Host & Gadget)

* Enumeration for HID/MSC/CDC/UVC; power budget; autosuspend behavior; gadget modes (ECM/RNDIS/MTP).

### Networking (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/BT)

* IPv4/IPv6, DHCP, DNS; **iperf3** throughput; packet loss/latency; roaming (Wi-Fi), BT pairing & profiles (A2DP/HFP).

### Display/Camera/Audio

* DRM mode set, EDID, tear-free; V4L2 capture formats and frame rates; ALSA playback/capture at rates, xrun handling.

### Power & Thermal

* s2idle/S3 cycles, runtime PM of major IP blocks; cpufreq transitions under load; thermal throttling at trip points with recovery.

### Security/OTA/Recovery

* Secure boot chain validation, key revocation; SELinux/AppArmor mode and denials; OTA apply/rollback/A-B slot integrity; kdump/pstore capture on panic.

## 5) Write concrete procedures (repeatable commands)

Keep commands inside test cases to eliminate guesswork. Samples:

* **Smoke boot**

  ```
  Power on → capture serial → login → dmesg -T | tee dmesg.txt
  Pass if: login < 30s AND no "Oops"/"BUG" in dmesg
  ```
* **Ethernet basic**

  ```
  ip link set eth0 up
  dhclient -v eth0
  ping -c 10 <gateway>
  iperf3 -c <server> -t 30
  Pass if: DHCP success; ping loss <=1%; throughput ≥ <target> Mbit/s
  ```
* **I²C scan + IDs**

  ```
  i2cdetect -y 0
  i2cget -y 0 0x1a 0x00
  Pass if: expected addresses respond; ID reg matches datasheet
  ```
* **Suspend/Resume loop**

  ```
  for i in $(seq 1 100); do
    rtcwake -m mem -s 10 || exit 1
    dmesg | tail -n 200 >> suspend.log
  done
  Pass if: 100/100 resumes; no device probe failures after resume
  ```

## 6) Define pass/fail criteria & KPIs

* **Binary criteria** per test (e.g., “no kernel warnings”, “ping loss ≤1%”).
* **Performance targets** with margin and variance: record **mean, p95** over ≥3 runs.
* **Stability**: MTBF during soak; zero panics; memory/FD leak drift <2%.

## 7) Execute in phases

1. **Provision**: flash images using documented commands (fastboot/dfu/NFS).
2. **Smoke gate** every build; fail fast and stop if P0 fails.
3. **Functional suites** in parallel by domain owners.
4. **Performance Power** on release candidates only (multiple runs).
5. **Stress/Soak** unattended with watchdog + remote PDU.
6. **Regression** daily/CI on known-good hardware set.
7. **Sign-off** only when exit criteria are met; produce release notes and archive artifacts.

## 8) Automate (CI-friendly)

* Use **LAVA/Labgrid/TBot/Robot + pytest**; store jobs & test scripts in repo; version with the code.
* Capture artifacts automatically: serial logs, `dmesg`, metrics (JSON/CSV), plots.
* Tag each run with image hash, DTB, kernel tag, board S/N, lab host.

**Example automation pointers** (also added to the template):

* LAVA job snippet for smoke gating.
* Matrix fields **Automation** and **Script/Job Ref** link every test to its script.

## 9) Defect triage workflow

* **When failing**: attach logs (serial, dmesg, traces), environment, exact image hashes, steps to reproduce, suspected commit.
* **Severity**: Critical/P0 (ship-stopper), High/P1, Medium/P2, Low.
* **Lifecycle**: New → Triaged (owner) → In-Progress → Fixed → Verified → Closed.
* **Regression tests**: add a new automated test for every fixed bug.

## 10) Reporting & handoff

* Dashboards: P0 pass rate, trend of failures, performance charts.
* Release packet: filled Test Plan + Test Matrix + raw logs + parsed metrics + Release Notes.
* Tag the repo and publish artifacts to immutable storage.

## Ready-to-use templates

* **Test Plan (Markdown)** with sections for scope, strategy, environment, criteria, design, automation, metrics, deliverables.
* **Test Matrix (CSV)** seeded with example rows (smoke boot, networking, I²C, boot time, 72h soak).

Again, grab them here:

* [Download the Test Plan template (Markdown)](sandbox:/mnt/data/BSP_Test_Plan_Template.md)
* [Download the Test Matrix (CSV)](sandbox:/mnt/data/BSP_Test_Matrix.csv)

If you want, I can also **pre-fill these for a specific board** (e.g., Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, or your Qualcomm board) with concrete commands, performance targets, and a small smoke-test script.
